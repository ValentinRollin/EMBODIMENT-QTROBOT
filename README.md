# EMBODIMENT-QTROBOT
Exploring embodiment impact for human robot interaction in a wizard of oz setting

The aim of this paper is to study the effect of physical appearance on human-robot
interaction. To this end, we set up an experiment to study the comparison of
interactions between a human and respectively a physical robot and its virtual
avatar in 3D. For this purpose, the qt-robot was used in the context of a "Wizard of
oz" type dialogue. The participants of the experiment were either adults or children
and one of the results obtained was to highlight the difference in perception
(cheating, emotions) between the two groups. We also observed a difference between
the perception of cheating in relation to the different embodiments of the robot.
